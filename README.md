# Enhancing Origin Prediction: Deep Learning Model for Diagnosing Premature Ventricular Contractions with Dual-Rhythm Analysis Focused on Cardiac Rotation

## Overview

This study compares the Dual-Rhythm model (incorporating both sinus rhythm and PVC) to the PVC model (using PVC alone) in predicting PVC origin on 12-lead ECGs. A hybrid Resnet50 and Transformer approach was applied to data from 593 patients across 11 centers, demonstrating superior performance of the Dual-Rhythm model.
